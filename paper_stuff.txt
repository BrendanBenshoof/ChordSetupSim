Using metrics to discuss our success is difficult as our desired change is in a behavior th . An obvious metric like the number of distinct sub-rings proves our technique works, but does not give us any information beyond that. In the unaltered simulation the number of rings stays constant and in the modified behavior it linearly reduces to one. The major metrics of number of links and average travel time both fall into normal ranges when the undesired behavior occurs. Each node has a constant number of links and the expected number of links is nodes * number of links * density. This number of links is unaffected by our undesired behavior as the total density of the ideal ring is equal to the sum of the densities of the sub-rings. Travel time for messages is unaffected as each sub-ring has sections that maintain the entire hash space, thus a message will be replied to, just by the wrong node.

The metrics we found to be of interest is the rate of link creation and variance in the number of links over time. We found after running 100 simulations for each algorithm the the "end behavior" of the number of links metrics was identical, finding a ceiling at around 300 links, but the behavior of each line differed greatly. The unaltered algorithm gave us a behavior which asymptotically approaches the expected 300 links. The altered algorithm however gave us a linear growth which ceiling-ed at the expected 300 links maximum. This is caused by by a component of the new algorithm that when a node changed rings it had to destroy all of it's current links. this loss appears to cancel out the curve-behavior of the unaltered algorithm. The variance of the unaltered-algorithm was greater at every point in time then the altered algorithm in increased over time. This indicates the unaltered algorithm’s behavior was heavily influenced by the random starting conditions of the simulation where the constant variance of the altered algorithm indicated it is more stable in respect to starting topology.
