Using metrics to discuss our sucess is difficult. An ovious metric like the number of distinct sub-rings proves our technique
works, but does not give us any information beyond that. In the un-altered
simulation the number of rings stays constant and in the modified behavoir
it linearly reduces to one. The major metrics
of number of links and average travel time both fall into normal ranges
when the undesried behavoir occurs. Each node has a constant number of 
links the expected number of links (nodes * number of links * density). 
this number of links is unaffected by our undesired behavoir as the total density
of the ideal ring is equal to the sum of the densities of the sub-rings. 
Travel time for messages is unaffected as each sub-ring has sections that
maintain the entire hash space, thus a message will be replied to, just
by the wrong node.

The metrics we found to be of interest is the rate of link creation
and varience in the number of links over time. We found after running 
100 simulations for each algorithim the the "end behavoir" of the number of
links metrics was idential, finding a ceiling at around 300 links, but 
the behavoir of each line differed greatly. The un-altered algorithim gave
us an O(1/x) behavoir which asymtotically approaches the expected
300 links. The altered algorithim however gave us a linear growth which
ceilinged at the expected 300 links maximum. This is caused by by a 
compoent of the new algorithim that when a node changed rings it had to
destroy all of it's current links. this loss appears to cancel out the 
curve-behavoir of the unaltered algorithim. The varience of the 
unlatered-algorithim was greater at every point in time then the altered
algorithim in increased over time. This indicates the unaltered algorithim's behavoir was heavily
influenced by the random starting conditions of the simulation where the
constant variance of the altered algorithim indicated it is more stable
in respect to starting topology.
